      IN THIS HTML FILE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE MUCH AT ALL. MOSTLY YOU WILL JUST
      NEED TO DEFINE AN EVENT FOR THE THREE BUTTONS BELOW. YOU ARE FREE TO CHANGE THE
      CSS FILE THAT IS ALREADY LINKED UP BUT YOU DO NOT NEED TO.

      MOSTLY, WE WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO WRITE UP A FEW
      SIMPLE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO IN THE STYLE.JS FILE (WHICH
      IS ALSO ALREADY LINKED UP FOR YOU).
