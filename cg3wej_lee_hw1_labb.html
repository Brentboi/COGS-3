            <dt>&lt;DOCTYPE&gt;</dt>
            <dd>A declaration that instructs the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</dd>

            <dt>How to use &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;</dt>
            <dt>&lt;ol&gt;</dt>
            <dd>A tag for an ordered list. To use this you will need to use the &lt;li&gt; tag for each of your items in the list.
                They'll then be numbered according to the order you put them in your html. </dd>
            <dt>&lt;ul&gt;</dt>
            <dd>A tag for an unordered list. Just like &lt;ol&gt;, you need to use the &lt;li&gt; tag for each of your items in the list.
                They'll be then bulleted in the list with no numbering.
            </dd>
            <dt>&lt;dt&gt;</dt>
            <dd>A tag for a description list. This list is a little different than the others. You will need to use &lt;dt&gt; for the term's name.
                Then you'll need to use &lt;dd&gt; for the description of the term.
            </dd>

            <dt>Difference between text editor and word processor?</dt>
            <dd>Text editors are for modifying plain text like ASCII or UTF-8. It's mostly used for programming languages like HTML or
                Javascript, etc. A word processor is just used for typing up documents or just editting text that you would print.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>What is the client-server model?</dt>
            <dd>The client-server model is a type of I guess relationship in applications. Basically the server allows the client to create
                certain functions, and these functions are done made on the request of the client. (I think of it kind of like supply and demand)

            <dt>FTP</dt>
            <dd>File Transfer Protocol. This is the standard network protocol that that computers use
                to transfer files between servers and clients on a network</dd>
            <dt>HTTP</dt>
            <dd>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This is probably the most common protocol used on the web. It determines how
                things are transmitted or formatted and also tells the servers or browsers what it should do in response.
            </dd>
            <dt>TCP/IP</dt>
            <dd>Transmission Control Protocol or Internet Protocol. It's a protocol for sending packets of data across two connected programs.</dd>
