       <h1>Salt and Pepper Squid</h1>
       <p>This is actually my favorite food, I don't really know how to cook anything, but I've been looking at this recipe for a while.
           Sorry if you were hoping for me to know how to actually cook.
       </p>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb squid</li>
            <li>1 tb spoon shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil</li>
            <li>5 cups of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semolina flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of white pepper</li>
            <li>2 green peppers sliced</li>
            <li>5 sliced garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of minced ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the squid by rinsing in cold water and cutting all the tentacles into bite size pieces.</li>
            <li>Marinate the squid in the shaoxing wine and sesame oil.</li>
            <li>Have a pot and fill it with oil, heat it up to about 325 degrees for deep frying.</li>
            <li>Mix the all purpose flour, semolina flour, cornmeal, salt, and white pepper into a mixture.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot enough rub the squid in the mixture and then drop it in the oil.</li>
            <li>Once they are done frying, lay them down on some paper towels to get rid of excess oil.</li>
            <li>Now we will stir fry the squid with the rest of the ingredients (ginger, garlic, green onions). That's it you're done.</li>
        </ol>
