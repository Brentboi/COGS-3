            <dt>How to define a table?</dt>
            <dd>You can define a table by using the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>tag.
            This will define a table in your code, but in order to make the proper tables
            we usually see, we need to use some other tags which will be described below.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This tag defines a row in the table. Use it when you want to add a single row to the table.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>&lt;th&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This tag allows us to add a header to the table. You should use this when making 
                labels describing what the data in the table is.
            </dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>&lt;td&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This is a regular cell in the table. Use this when you want to input the data for your table.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>&lt;thead&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This tag is used to group the head of the elements in the table. It makes it easier to style contents of these elements. Kind of lets the browser know where is the top of the table.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This tag is used to group the bottom elements of the table. It makes it simpler to group and style if you have a total or some summation for your table.
                It also helps the browser find the bottom or end of the table.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt><code>&lt;caption&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>This allows you to caption your table. Kind of like a table's title per se.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>What is the difference between <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code>?</dt>
            <dd><code>colspan</code> defines the nubmer of columns a cell should take up, while <code>rowspan</code> defines the number
                of rows a cell should take up.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>What is the difference between cell spacing and padding?</dt>
            <dd>Cell spacing defines how much pixels should be in between different cells, while padding tells us
                how much space should be between the cell's walls and the contents within that cell.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>How do you define table borders? Control border widths?</dt>
            <dd>You can define table borders by adding border to the opening tag of the table like this:
                <code>&lt;table border="1"&gt;</code>. This tells us the browser we want to show borders. You can control border
                widths by using css and editing the attributes <code>border-width,border-left-width,border-right-width,...</code>
                and more.
            </dd>

        </dl>
        <h1>Definitions</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>&lt;DOCTYPE&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>A declaration that instructs the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</dd>
            <br>

            <dt>How to use <code>&lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;</code></dt>
            <dt><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>A tag for an ordered list. To use this you will need to use the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag for each of your items in the list.
                They'll then be numbered according to the order you put them in your html. </dd>
            <dt><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>A tag for an unordered list. Just like <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, you need to use the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag for each of your items in the list.
                They'll be then bulleted in the list with no numbering.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>&lt;dt&gt;</code></dt>
            <dd>A tag for a description list. This list is a little different than the others. You will need to use &lt;dt&gt; for the term's name.
                Then you'll need to use <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> for the description of the term.
            </dd>
            <br>

            <dt>Difference between text editor and word processor?</dt>
            <dd>Text editors are for modifying plain text like <code>ASCII</code> or <code>UTF-8</code>. It's mostly used for programming languages like HTML or
                Javascript, etc. A word processor is just used for typing up documents or just editting text that you would print.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>What is the client-server model?</dt>
            <dd>The client-server model is a type of I guess relationship in applications. Basically the server allows the client to create
                certain functions, and these functions are done made on the request of the client. (I think of it kind of like supply and demand)
            </dd>
            <br>

            <dt><code>FTP</code></dt>
            <dd>File Transfer Protocol. This is the standard network protocol that that computers use
                to transfer files between servers and clients on a network</dd>
            <dt><code>HTTP</code></dt>
            <dd>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This is probably the most common protocol used on the web. It determines how
                things are transmitted or formatted and also tells the servers or browsers what it should do in response.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>TCP/IP</code></dt>
            <dd>Transmission Control Protocol or Internet Protocol. It's a protocol for sending packets of data across two connected programs.</dd>
