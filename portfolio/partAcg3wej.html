        <p>Some of these portfolios are from people I know and others I just found online.</p>

              <p>When I look at this resume I think it's pretty nice. You get to know who the person is and what he looks like and what he's done. Some things I don't like though are the color scheme, spelling errors, and some unnecessary things that make him look bad, like saying he's an amateur.</p>

                <p>I like this portfolio because the design is very minimalistic,fluid, and matches well with the color scheme. I think it's kind of
                  unclear what they actually do though from the get go which is bad. Also sometimes the font and menu icons are hard to see.</p>

                <p>This is my favorite portfolio out of all of them so far. It shows us what the person is
                  interested as well as there education. It's seperated very well too with the colors on each section.
                  I think I don't really have anything bad to say about this one.</p>

                <p>Ian's page is pretty nice color scheme wise. I think another thing he does nicely is putting up
                   the projects he's done in the middle of the page. This allows people interested in his work to see examples.
                   Another cool thing he does is the reviews he has on the bottom.

                <p>Jonny's page immediately let's us know what he does and where he's based which is cool. His color scheme of black, white and red works good in my opinion as well.
                  He lists projects and contacts after which is a nice lead in because if people are interested after seeing his projects they will want to contact him. So the ordering is nice.</p>
